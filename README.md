# aider: AI Pair Programmer in your terminal

Aider is an AI pair programmer that helps you code in your terminal. It uses large language models to edit code in your local git repository.

Ask aider to add features, fix bugs, write tests, refactor, and more.  Just describe what you want and aider will modify the code.

Aider works with many different language models, including GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude 3, Gemini, Ollama, Llama.cpp and more.
